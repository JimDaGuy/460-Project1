    <h2 id="storyTitle">The Story Behind the Data</h2>
    <p class="storyParagraph">
      Seeing as our data is missing several countries, we can
      only speculate about the countries that have data associated
      with them. 
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h3 class="storySubtitle">The United States</h3>
    <p class="storyParagraph">
      From the start, it was fairly apparent that the
      United States seems to be the largest greenhouse gas emissions
      producer in our dataset. The U.S. consistently set the bar for the
      highest carbon dioxide(co2), hydrofluorocarbons(hcfs), nitrous
      oxide(n2o), and sulphur hexafluoride(sf6) emissions every year
      from 1990 to 2014. The only category the U.S. was not the lead
      producer of was methane(ch4), trailing closely behind Russia
      most years.
    </p>
    <h3 class="storySubtitle">The Peaks</h3>
    <p class="storyParagraph">
      Listed below are the years and ammounts of peak emissions for
      each category of greenhouse gas in our data. As expected, the
      United States holds all of them except for methane. While the U.S.
      leads in all other categories, it should be noted that methane is
      roughly 30 times more potent than carbon dioxide, contributing much
      more to global warming

    <h3 class="storySubtitle">Emissions Disparity</h3>
    <p id="lastParagraph" class="storyParagraph">
      While the United States and Russia are large contributors to
      global emissions of greenhouse gasses, the data shows that in
      all the other countries displayed, greenhouse gas emissions
      rarely if ever rise above half of Russia's emissions or even
      a fifth of the United States' emissions. This is likely in part
      due to the disparity in their populations but the difference is
      still staggering.
